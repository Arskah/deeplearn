# Deeplearn local setup with Poetry

## Prerequisities

- Python 3.X (`pyproject.toml` assumes ^3.9, but could be an older version)
- Poetry [https://python-poetry.org/docs/](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

## Installation

- Recommendation: run

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

to install virtualenv inside project folder (under `.venv`)

-

```bash
poetry install
```
